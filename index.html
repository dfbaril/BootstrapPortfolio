          <p>Dain Baril is the author of this website. He is an army brat, with a brother and sister. He's lived all over the US, at different army posts. He has worked various jobs in manual labor and in the service industry, and he's hoping to break into the web development field. He is starting to really enjoy it, and especially has enjoyed working with bootstrap. He's starting to get into Javascript and jQuery, with the rest of his class.</p>
           <p>He has an eclectic assortment of interests, which include technology, playing saxophone, and watching motorsports. His favorite motorsport is Formula 1. He is often surprised that he has such a huge interest in cars, because he used to think cars were just a means to get from A to B, but now he eats his words every March, when the F1 season starts.</p>
